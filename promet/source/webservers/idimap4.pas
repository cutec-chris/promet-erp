            WARNING:
            KNOWN ISSUES AND WORKAROUNDS AS OF 27TH MAY 2003:
            AppendMsg is erratic with some IMAP servers, if called with invalid
              parameters, you may be better using CopyMsgs instead, particularly
              while you are in the debugging stage.
            (UID)RetrievePart(Peek) functions occasionally cause erratic crashes,
              again if invalid parameters are used (e.g. calling them with the
              wrong encoding specified).
              The RetrievePartToFile versions are more resilient.
              These functions were not part of the Indy 9 release anyway.
            UIDRetrieveAllHeaders does nothing (it never did), but this is of
              little practical use - you are better off using a "for" loop on the
              number of messages in the mailbox and using GetUID to get all the
              UIDs quickly, before someone else deletes one, then using
              UIDRetrieveHeader on those UIDs.
            This is only for Windows, no work has been done on a Linux version.

  IMAP 4 (Internet Message Access Protocol - Version 4 Rev 1)
  By Idan Cohen i_cohen@yahoo.com

  2001-FEB-27 IC: First version most of the IMAP features are implemented and
                  the core IdPOP3 features are implemented to allow a seamless
                  switch.
                  The unit is currently oriented to a session connection and not
                  to constant connection, because of that server events that are
                  raised from another user actions are not supported.
  2001-APR-18 IC: Added support for the session's connection state with a
                  special exception for commands preformed in wrong connection
                  states. Exceptions were also added for response errors.
  2001-MAY-05 IC:

  2001-Mar-13 DS: Fixed Bug # 494813 in CheckMsgSeen where LastCmdResult.Text
                  was not using the Ln index variable to access server
                  responses.

  2002-Apr-12 DS: fixed bug # 506026 in TIdIMAP4.ListSubscribedMailBoxes.  Call
                  ParseLSubResut instead of ParseListResult.

  2003-Mar-31 CC: Added GetUID and UIDSearchMailBox, sorted out some bugs (details
                  shown in comments in those functions which start with "CC:").

  2003-Apr-15 CC2:Sorted out some more bugs (details shown in comments in those
                  functions which start with "CC2:").  Set FMailBoxSeparator
                  in ParseListResult and ParseLSubResult.
                  Some IMAP servers generally return "OK completed" even if they
                  returned no data, such as passing a non-existent message
                  number to them: they possibly should return NO or BAD; the
                  functions here have been changed to return FALSE unless they
                  get good data back, even if the server answers OK.  Similar
                  change made for other functions.
                  There are a few exceptions, e.g. ListMailBoxes may only return
                  "OK completed" if the user has no mailboxes, these are noted.
                  Also, RetrieveStructure(), UIDRetrieveStructure, RetrievePart,
                  UIDRetrievePart, RetrievePartPeek and UIDRetrievePartPeek
                  added to allow user to find the structure of a message and
                  just retrieve the part or parts he needs.

  2003-Apr-30 CC3:Added functionality to retrieve the text of a message (only)
                  via RetrieveText / UIDRetrieveText / RetrieveTextPeek /
                  UIDRetrieveTextPeek.
                  Return codes now generally reflect if the function succeeded
                  instead of returning True even though function fails.

  2003-May-15 CC4:Added functionality to retrieve individual parts of a message
                  to a file, including the decoding of those parts.

  2003-May-29 CC5:Response of some servers to UID version of commands varies,
                  code changed to deal with those (UID position varies).
                  Some servers return NO such as when you request an envelope
                  for a message number that does not exist: functions return
                  False instead of throwing an exception, as was done for other
                  servers.  The general logic is that if a valid result is
                  returned from the IMAP server, return True;  if there is no
                  result (but the command is validly structured), return FALSE;
                  if the command is badly structured or if it gives a response
                  that this code does not expect, throw an exception (typically
                  when we get a BAD response instead of OK or NO).
                  Added IsNumberValid, IsUIDValid to prevent rubbishy parameters
                  being passed through to IMAP functions.
                  Sender field now filled in correctly in ParseEnvelope
                  functions.
                  All fields in ParseEnvelopeAddress are cleared out first,
                  avoids an unwitting error where some entries, such as CC list,
                  will append entries to existing entries.
                  Full test script now used that tests every TIdIMAP command,
                  more bugs eradicated.
                  First version to pass testing against both CommuniGate and
                  Cyrus IMAP servers.
                  Not tested against Microsoft Exchange, don't have an Exchange
                  account to test it against.
  2003-Jun-10 CC6:Added (UID)RetrieveEnvelopeRaw, in case the user wants to do
                  their own envelope parsing.
                  Code in RetrievePart altered to make it more consistent.
                  Altered to incorporate Indy 10's use of IdReplyIMAP4 (not
                  complete at this stage).
                  ReceiveBody added to IdIMAP4, due to the response of some
                  servers, which gets (UID)Receive(Peek) functions to work on
                  more servers.

{ TODO -oIC :
Change the mailbox list commands so that they receive TMailBoxTree
structures and so they can store in them the mailbox name and it's attributes. }

{ TODO -oIC :
Add support for \* special flag in messages, and check for \Recent
flag in STORE command because it cant be stored (will get no reply!!!) }

{ TODO -oIC :
5.1.2.  Mailbox Namespace Naming Convention
By convention, the first hierarchical element of any mailbox name
which begins with "#" identifies the "namespace" of the remainder of
the name.  This makes it possible to disambiguate between different
types of mailbox stores, each of which have their own namespaces.
For example, implementations which offer access to USENET
newsgroups MAY use the "#news" namespace to partition the USENET
newsgroup namespace from that of other mailboxes.  Thus, the
comp.mail.misc newsgroup would have an mailbox name of
"#news.comp.mail.misc", and the name "comp.mail.misc" could refer
to a different object (e.g. a user's private mailbox). }    {Do not Localize}

{ TO BE CONSIDERED -CC :
Double-quotes in mailbox names can cause major but subtle failures.  Maybe
add the automatic stripping of double-quotes if passed in mailbox names,
to avoid ending up with ""INBOX""
